= Scene Tree =

A scene tree is a way to represent a scene where each object is related to another spatially via parent/child relationship.  ANode class is super class to all other objects in a tree.  It stores position, scale and rotation.  However these values are always in relation to node's parent.  

In this way it is easy to construct a fairly complex structure as a tree, then move parts of it by moving the root of that part, and having all children of this node move rigidly with the parent, as well as rotate or scale with the parent.
